✅ Replit Agent Prompt: Build a Human Resource Management System
Project Name: HRMS Human Resource Management System ERP
Project Description:
Midcai Consulting Private Limited, an IT services company, requires a comprehensive web-based
ERP system to streamline its workforce and organizational operations. The integrated HRMS

In addition to HR-related modules, the system will include foundational ERP components like
company accounts, stock management, buying & selling, and manufacturing (as
placeholders for future expansion).
The platform will provide role-based access for different user types — Administrators, HR
professionals, Managers, and Employees — and support operations across various
departments, including:
● Project Management
● Marketing
● Sales
● Human Resources
● Accounts

The ERP will also maintain comprehensive company details such as company profile, structure,
policies, and contact information, ensuring all departments operate in a unified and efficient
system.
